# Abstract
Originating from cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become one of the most
widely used measures for variable importance in applied Machine Learning. However, the
statistical understanding of Shapley values is still limited. In this paper we take a nonparametric
(or smoothing) perspective by proposing Shapley curves as a local measure for
variable importance. We propose two estimation strategies and derive the consistency and
asymptotic normality both under independence and dependence among the features. This
allows us to construct confidence intervals in order to conduct inference on the estimated
Shapley curves. In an empirical application, we analyze the attributes which drive the
prices of cars.
